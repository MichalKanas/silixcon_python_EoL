# silixcon_python_EoL

Welcome to the silixcon_python_EoL documentation! This repository provides an EXAMPLE of production scripts built around siliXcon SWTools for seamless integration and control of siliXcon devices using Python.

## Getting Started
Connect siliXcon controller and run the example.py script provided in this repository. This script demonstrates the usage of various functions and showcases the capabilities of the production scripts.

```bash
python example.py
```

## Description
The core components of this repository are the swtools.py and yos_device.py scripts. These scripts serve as wrappers around the siliXcon SWTools, enabling you to utilize Python functions for efficient control and interaction with siliXcon devices.

## Include in PYTHONPATH:
For easy accessibility from any location, consider adding the path to the `swtools.py` and `yos_device.py` scripts to the PYTHONPATH environmental variable.
